# The "pull request" – feeding back to the main repository

MAgPIE lives through its community of developers and is based on the idea
that all research should be open, accessible and usable. While not enforced by
any contract or license, we ask all developers to feed their model developments
back to the main repository to make them more easily accessible to the whole
community. While doing so means additional effort by the developer in order
to fulfill the requirements for merging it into the main branch of the model
(explained further down below), it comes with many advantages:

* Developments get a **higher visibility** when put in the main repository compared
to keeping them in a personal or even private repository. This increases
the likelihood that the new research is taken up, further checked and finally
cited in upcoming work.

* Feeding your work back to the main repository will **encourage others** to do the
same which will grant access to cool new features one otherwise would not get.

* Feeding developments back ensures that others' future developments are **compatible**
with one's own work, and avoids the situation where one's own model becomes too difficult
to merge into the main model version.

* In publications you will be able to simply **refer to a main release** of the model
rather than needing to explain how your specific version relates to the main
line of the model.

Experience of the past years have shown us that:

1. New features in the model will be taken up by researchers and leading to new and exciting 
research and,
2. The researcher originally developing that feature will benefit from it through new 
collaborations and publications.

# How do pull requests (PR) work?

Whenever you update your fork from the main repository (e.g. `magpiemodel:develop`) you use the 
Git command `pull`. This attempts to merge the code from the main repository into your forked repository. A 
"pull request" operates similarly, except from the other direction. By notifying
the maintainers of the main repository that you have code that you would like to merge, you start
a dialogue wherein the code can be reviewed and tested before it is incorporated into the main repository. 
For MAgPIE, this process takes place over GitHub.com. After reviewing your code, the maintainers "pull" 
from your repository into the main repository.

# Steps to submitting a pull request

Below is a step-by-step guide to submitting a pull request, from committing to your own fork
to filling out the PR template itself. For the purposes of this tutorial, the PR includes a
new output script, `FSEC_environmentalPollutants.R`.

---

## On your local fork

### Complete and thoroughly test your code changes

When actively developing MAgPIE, you should refrain from making additions to the `master` branch.
In general one should either create branches off of your fork of `develop` branch for specific features, or 
change the fork's `develop` branch itself.

When developing the MAgPIE model, please following the coding etiquette available 
[here](https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/doc/magpie/4.4.0/).

This is the output script, currently on the `develop` branch of my local, forked repository 
(`mscrawford/magpiemodel:develop`), that will be included into the `magpiemodel:develop` branch:

```R

# |  of MAgPIE and licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later. Under Section 7 of

# |  MAgPIE License Exception, version 1.0 (see LICENSE file).

# --------------------------------------------------------------

# Version 1.00 - Michael Crawford

library(lucode2)
library(magpie4)

message("Starting FSEC environmental pollutants output runscript")

############################# BASIC CONFIGURATION #######################################
if (!exists("source_include")) {

    title       <- NULL
    outputdir   <- NULL

    # Define arguments that can be read from command line
    readArgs("outputdir", "title")

}
#########################################################################################

message("Script started for output directory: ", outputdir)
load(file.path(outputdir, "config.Rdata"))
title <- cfg$title

message("Generating environmental pollutants output for the run: ", title)
gdx <- file.path(outputdir, "fulldata.gdx")

baseDir <- getwd()
pollutantsOutputDir <- file.path(baseDir, "output", "pollutants")
if (!dir.exists(pollutantsOutputDir)) {
    dir.create(pollutantsOutputDir)
}

out <- getReportGridPollutants(gdx = gdx, reportOutputDir = pollutantsOutputDir, magpieOutputDir = outputdir, scenario = title)
```

In particular, at this point you should **pull the most recent `magpiemodel:develop` branch 
into your repository**. This ensures that your changes are already embedded into the current 
`magpiemodel:develop` branch and will streamline the process of testing your innovations and 
later merging them.


--- 

### Modify the `CHANGELOG.md`

It's critically important that you **add your various changes to the `CHANGELOG.md`** in the base 
directory of your fork. This enables us to trace developments over time and, eventually, 
package them cleanly into release candidates. Below is the current state of the unreleased MAgPIE 
develop branch:

```md
# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https:/keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https:/semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).


## [Unreleased]

### changed
 - **scripts** added new disaggregation script to provide grid cell level BII
 - **inputs** updated non-agricultural water use scenarios (watdem_nonagr_grper.cs3)
 - **config** included switch for non-agricultural water demand (s42_watdem_nonagr_scenario) in scenario_config.csv
 - **config** included SHAPE SDP scenarios in scenario_config.csv
 - **34_urban** added set urban_scen34 and the switch c34_urban_scenario

- **scripts** output/projects/FSEC_environmentalPollutants.R to create output datasets of pollutants for the FSEC project

### removed

### fixed
- **inputs** included data for Sudan
- **18_residues** off realization; missing variable declarations
- **34_urban** exo_nov21 realization; bugfix in calculation of biodiversity value
- **50_nr_soil_budget** off realization; missing variable declarations

- **scripts** fixed misleading warning in check_config
```

Note that the `CHANGELOG` separates all code changes into `changed`, `added`, `removed`, and `fixed`. If you made multiple
commits which included changes, additions, and removals, these must be broken down here. In practice, it is
better _git_ etiquette (i.e. nicer for the maintainers) to have smaller, discrete PRs that implement a singular feature or advancement, than larger PRs implementing many disconnected features simultaneously.


---

In particular I have added a single line, detailing the addition of the `FSEC_environmentalPollutants.R` 
output script.

![PR_1](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_1_CHANGELOG.png)


---

### Commit your changes to your local fork

With my added output script and corresponding update to the `CHANGELOG.md`, I need to commit my changes and push 
them to my own fork. I first _staged_ the changes (by running `git add *` in the terminal) and now _commit_ them:

![PR_2](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_2_commit.png)


---

### Push the new commit to your repository on GitHub

Unless you've heavily customized your fork, you will want to push this new commit to `origin:develop`, as below:

![PR_3](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_3_push.png)


---

## On your GitHub account

### Creating a new PR

From here we initiate the PR from `github.com`. Navigating to my own fork, we see my new commit is represented:

![PR_4](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_4_GitHub_recentCommit.png)

One can futher observe that my branch is `1 commit ahead of magpiemodel:develop`.


---

I now navigate to `Pull requests` in the top-left menu, clicking `New pull request`.

![PR_5](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_5_GitHub_createPullRequest.png)


---

Now is a key step wherein you should check a number of details before creating your new pull request.

![PR_6](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_6_GitHub_createPullRequest2.png)

1. Verify that you are merging **from** your correct, forked, branch **to** the correct branch of the `magpiemodel/magpie` 
repository (this should almost without exception be the `develop` branch).
2. Check that your changes are as expected, and fully represented. For example, if want to merge multiple commits, are 
they all there?
3. Can the two branches be automatically merged? If not, you need to pull the most recent `magpiemodel:develop` branch 
and merge these latest changes into your own branch.


> A tip: It is possible to pull from the `magpiemodel:develop` branch to your fork (likely `origin:develop`) through GitHub.com, and then you could pull from the origin to your local machine. Another potentially convenient method could be adding an `upstream` remote the your git repository on your local machine, as [here](https://gist.github.com/CristinaSolana/1885435).


---

### The PR template

The PR template is a space for you to describe the changes you've made to the MAgPIE model and provide information 
for MAgPIE's maintainers to review the code and assess the level of detail needed to safely integrate it into
the main repository. One should go through the template thoroughly and address each checkbox.

![PR_7](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_7_GitHub_PRTemplate.png)

---

#### A breakdown of the PR template

1. **Label your pull request**. The amount of time invested into validating your code changes scales with the 
risk in merging them. In general, changing input files and the core model are very high risk changes and need special
attention. Shown in this tutorial however, adding start scripts are a low risk change. Therefore I add the `low risk` 
label from the label list (by clicking the wrench on on the right).
1. **Provide additional information based on the PR label**.
1. **Performance gain/loss**. For medium and high risk changes, one must report the runtime of the new branch. High risk 
in particular should be compared with a control run of the `magpiemodel:develop` branch. Ideally additions to the code
should not incur runtime changes. If they do, there must be good reasons for it.
1. **Added changes to `CHANGELOG.md`**.
1. **Compilation check**. Make sure that your model compiles successfully. Navigate to your `magpie` directory and within 
the console run `gams main.gms action=c`.

> A tip: It may be necessary - if you haven't already run the model in your directory - to download the input data from the PIK
> servers. To do so, run `Rscript start.R` and select `3: download data | just download default.cfg input data`.

1. **No hard-coded numbers and cluster/country/region names**. MAgPIE is able to run across flexible cluster, country, and 
region definitions. This flexibility stems from these definitions only entering the model through input parameters as the
model is being started. Thus, hard-coding these definitions will lead to erronous results.
1. **The new code doesn't contain declared but unused parameters or variables**.
1. **Where relevant, In-code comments added including documentation comments**.
1. **Make sure that the documentation worked for your additions**.
1. **Changes to the `magpie4` enable postprocessing of any new model output**. `magpie4` is the [R repository](https://github.com/pik-piam/magpie4) which is used to generate analyses from the model output datasets.
1. **Self-review of my own code**. Perhaps the most important checkbox. Are you certain that your code does what you think it
does?
1. **For high risk runs: validation of major model indicators - Land-use, emissions, food prices, Tau**. Screenshots of 
the Shinyapp at the with regional level for a default run of both your new developments and the current `magpiemodel:develop` 
branch are appropriate for most changes.

After completing the PR template you should request at least two reviewers from the MAgPIE mainanence team.

---

#### The review process

After recieving your PR request, both MAgPIE maintainers will independently review your changes and request 
clarifications or changes as appropriate. 

![PR_8](../assets/images/tutorials/PR_8_GitHub_PRTemplate_Reviewers.png)

The reviewers, one of whom must be from the Research and Software Engineering (RSE) department at PIK, use the above
checklist. After this interaction has been completed, they will accept the PR and it will be automatically merged 
into the `magpiemodel:develop` branch.
