The first workshop session will give you an overview about the model code, how it is managed and how it is read. The first tutorial will give a brief introduction into the version management of MAgPIE via git/github, following by an overview about the GAMS code and the underlying modules and realizations. The last tutorial will focus on the model documentation, where it can be found and how it is created.
