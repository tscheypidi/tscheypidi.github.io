  - title: Sticky and improvements in spatially explicit outputs
    abstract: "In this story, I would like to explain what's behind sticky and
    also give examples on the improvements it brings to spatially-explicit data.
    If time allows (and also if it's need), I could also deepen on adaptation
    and climate impacts reduction for the agricultural sector."

  - title: "Enhancing total factor productivity in China for food and
    environmental security"
    abstract: "In this study, we follow Wang et al. (2020) to combine an
    agro-economic land system model (MAgPIE) with a well-recognized TFP
    calculation method (DEA) to measure China’s TFP changes in two distinct
    steps. First, this study uses MAgPIE to simulate the production outcomes
    based on the endogenous TC and different future socioeconomic scenarios.
    Second, we employ DEA to estimate TFP changes in China and further analysis
    the impact of TFP on the food and environment.\n\n
    This paper will demonstrate the growth of China's agricultural TFP and its
    impact on the food and environment.Our results show that agricultural TFP in
    China will continue to grow but vary across different scenarios.The growth of
    TFP ensures food security, decreases the consumer prices and increases
    self-sufficiency. The development of TFP also has important implications for
    the environment. Scarcity of agricultural water is alleviated as the increase
    in TFP gives room for adjustment of the spatial planting structure."

  - title: Global Innovation Needs Assessments (GINAs)
    abstract: "The Global Innovation Needs Assessments (GINAs) project, funded
    by ClimateWorks, provides an analytical framework for why and how much
    governments should spend on innovation to reach net zero emissions. MAgPIE
    was used together with Vivid's in-house energy model to quantify the benefits
    associated with innovation. We modelled five scenarios:

    * A central 1.5C scenario

    * Four \"innovation\" scenarios, each adding a different innovation to the
      central scenario. \n\n

    The emissions reductions achieved by each innovation scenario relative to
    the central scenario represented the innovation's mitigation benefits. To
    estimate the economic value of those benefits, we assumed that any mitigation
    in the land use sector would directly result in a higher carbon budget for
    the energy sector, reducing energy system costs. MAgPIE outputs also informed
    the estimation of the GVA and jobs associated with greater innovation, and the
    innovation investment need to support a Net Zero pathway."

  - title: Soft-linking MAgPIE and MESSAGE
    abstract: "As foundation for future work, we are coupling MAgPIE and the
    MESSAGEix framework. Initially, we’re using a soft-link approach similar to
    the MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM land-use emulator matrix. In this approach, a set of
    land-use scenarios is integrated into the MESSAGE energy model via some of
    their core outputs relevant for the energy system, e.g., bioenergy production
    potential and associated AFOLU GHG emissions. Scenarios are defined based
    on 2100 target prices for bioenergy per GJ produced and GHG emissions per
    tCO2eq. To achieve such a soft link for MAgPIE, we modify the model to take
    bioenergy prices as input instead of demands, linearly implemented between
    2020 and 2100. Similarly, for GHG emissions, we create a new module
    realization implementing linear price trajectories for an easy to change
    target setting.  In this MAgPIE story, we will present our approach, issues
    we ran into, and first results."

  - title: Dollar per Kelvin - From physical change to economic driver
    abstract: "Scenarios limiting climate change to 2°C or even 1.5°C frequently
    require large-scale forestation efforts to buy precious time for the
    phase-out of fossil fuels. However, in addition to removing CO2, forests
    change their local climate. This secondary, physical effect is routinely
    overlooked in scenarios despite studies demonstrating its impact to be
    similar to the CO2 removal for 20 years. One reason for this neglect is the
    mismatch between drivers of the physical Earth system and the economic world
    of scenario-building models. Here I show how I bridged this gap to consider
    local temperature changes in the cost optimization of MAgPIE."
