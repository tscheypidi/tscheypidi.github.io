  - title: "Use of a global model answering regional questions: Case Study
    from India"
    abstract: "In this story, I will talk about the experiences of using a global
    model to answer policy relevant questions for India. Under the Food,
    Agriculture, Biodiversity and Land-Use project, our team in undertaking model
    development and research exercise to pursue interesting policy questions for
    India such as introduction of a biofuel policy, policy shocks that focus on
    water use reduction as well as closing the yield gap for India."

  - title: "Meeting the Water Redlines in China: Implications for Food, Trade,
    and GHG Emissions"
    abstract: "China initiates a suite of water policies – water redlines to
    address the escalating water scarcity, while the impacts of water policies
    on food and environment systems are yet assessed. Here we develop detailed
    scenarios of the water redlines regarding water quantity–water cap and
    irrigation efficiency to assess their impacts using an agro-economic land
    system model (MAgPIE). The results show that water cap and irrigation
    efficiency redlines can reduce agricultural water use, without influencing
    food security. However, China would need to increase import of crops and
    livestock products to meet the water cap in 2030. Water cap redline can
    induce additional CO2 and CH4 emissions due to cropland expansion, but fewer
    N2O emissions because of less fertilizer use. By contrast, improving
    irrigation efficiency has a reversed effect, with a reduction of CO2 and CH4
    emissions but an increase of N2O emissions. The impacts of the synergy of
    the two redlines are dominated by the water cap redline."

  - title: The Inevitable Policy Response
    abstract: "This [project](https://www.unpri.org/inevitable-policy-response/the-inevitable-policy-response-2021-forecast-policy-scenario-and-15c-required-policy-scenario/8726.article)
    aims to fundamentally re-orientate the expectations,
    actions and disclosure reporting of both private and public actors toward an
    ‘inevitable’ business-as-usual world in which a transition to a net zero
    pathway comes late and abruptly, and involves significant economic
    disruption. IPR provides greater detail on the food and land use system in
    modelling its interaction with the energy system and economy. This reveals
    how critical assumptions on food and land use emissions and Nature-Based
    Solutions (NBS) are to achieving climate goals.\n\n
    MagPIE outputs were used as an input into a NBS model, which combined MAgPIE
    insights with NBS literature to estimate NBS supply. Customised inputs on
    regions, diet, bioenergy and carbon pricing were used to specify the
    scenario for the modelling."

  - title: "Taking the landscape perspective with MAgPIE - insights from the
    MAgPIE-SEALS coupling"
    abstract: "The landscape perspective is key for understanding how future
    land-use changes might affect the supply of crucial nature's contribution to
    people (NCP). Here, I will show examples of how MAgPIE can be applied to
    assess how global land-use dynamics affect the supply of critical regulating
    NCP that underpin the resilience and long-term productivity of farmed
    landscapes. A key aspect of this work is the preparation of future
    land-cover maps at field-scale (300x300 Meter spatial resolution at the
    equator) by linking the Spatial Economic Allocation Landscape Simulator
    (SEALS) with MAgPIE. SEALS utilizes adjacency relationships, physical
    suitability and constraints on cultivation for land cover allocation. The
    MAgPIE-SEALS framework can be used to derive fine-scale changes in
    landscape structure, pollination, and soil erosion, for providing nuanced
    global assessments of changes in multiple material and regulating NCP
    across different land-use futures."

  - title: Impact of the Circular Economy in halting biodiversity loss
    abstract: "This study assessed how much biodiversity loss can be halted in a
    Circular Economy (CE) scenario by 2050. We modelled four sectors – food &
    agriculture, buildings, forestry, and textiles. Levers include replacing
    meat and dairy with alternative proteins, defining new timber demand
    projections to simulate wood re-use and recycling, reducing urban areas to
    account for increases in urban density, and reducing fibre demand to
    simulate clothing re-use and recycling. The CE scenario halts and starts to
    reverse biodiversity loss. The food & agriculture lever had the greatest
    impact (73%) of the four sectors, followed by buildings (10%), textiles (9%)
    and forestry (8%). Key magpie developments include making minor edits to the
    food module to allow for the specification of exogenous diet shift scenarios
    in  in every time period as well as editing the BII of some agricultural and
    forest areas using the PREDICTS database to help simulate regenerative
    practices."
