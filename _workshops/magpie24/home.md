Welcome to the homepage for the MAgPIE 24 conference.

After a one-year break, we held our next MAgPIE workshop & stories event in mid-April 2024. This time, we organized it in a hybrid format, hosted on the Telegrafenberg at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. During this 3-day event, we had a mix of an introduction workshop for the MAgPIE model and the underlying MADRaT data processing framework, as well as two MAgPIE stories sessions where current users and developers of the model presented their most recent work.

Details about the stories which were presented can still be found here:
