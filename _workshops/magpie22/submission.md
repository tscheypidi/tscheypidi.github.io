  The workshop will be executed based on the teleconferencing system Zoom provided by Zoom Video Communications, Inc. ("Zoom"), 55 Almaden Boulevard, 6th Floor, San Jose, CA 95113. In individual cases, we are planning recordings of speakers. In these cases, we will inform you about it separately. If you participate in discussions, you and your contributions to the discussion by audio, video and/or chat will be a part of the conference session and will be streamed using the Zoom infrastructure and might be transferred to the USA or other Zoom computing centers in the world. We will not do any recordings of participant discussions sessions. At the same time, in deference to the other participants of the conference and to ensure compliance with EU data protection law, we kindly ask you to not film, take photos, record or further publish any material of the conference and the following discussion. Also please do not forward the Zoom link to third parties. Your participation in these Zoom sessions is not required by law or contract.
