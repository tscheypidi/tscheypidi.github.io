### **Mar 4<sup>th</sup> - Mar 16<sup>th</sup> 2022** MAgPIE22 workshop & stories

After our successful [MAgPIE] online training workshop last year, it is time again for next round. Due to COVID19, but also due to the lower participation barrier we decided to keep the online course format with the workshop being streched over 5 days with sessions of 1-3 hours each day. These sessions will take place from **Mar 7<sup>th</sup> to Mar 11<sup>th</sup> 2022** each starting at 10am UTC.

As last year the workshop will be preceded by a pre event on **Mar 4<sup>th</sup>** and will be based on the [MAgPIE tutorials] available online and presented by various members of the [MAgPIE] development team, giving you the opportunity to not only getting to know the model but also the team behind it. Sessions will address different levels of experience from absolute beginners to more experienced MAgPIE users and participants are encouraged to select sessions based on their own experience level and interest.

As a **new** element this year, the model introduced workshops will be followed by two **MAgPIE stories** sessions on **Mar 15<sup>th</sup> and Mar 16<sup>th</sup> 2022**. These session will address the continously increasing community of MAgPIE developers and users around the world by creating a room to present own work and experiences around the MAgPIE model. A **call for contributions** will ~~be published soon~~ is now [online](../../../stories/call) for which we would like to encourage everyone to submit their current work, plans, struggles or success stories around the model.

Like last year all events will be free of charge but will require a **registration**. Like the call for contributions also the registration page will go online within the next days.
