We are happy to see that our workshop triggered quite some interest. **Thanks for all the registrations!** In order to keep the workshop manageable, we decided to close the registration for this year's workshop. We are already planning our workshop for next year, so please stay tuned or visit our workshop material [online](https://github.com/magpiemodel/tutorials), in case you didn't manage to register this time.
