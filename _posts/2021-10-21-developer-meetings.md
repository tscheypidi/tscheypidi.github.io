Besides the upcoming **MAgPIE22** we have just opened another
format for MAgPIE developer: The 4-weekly **Open4All MAgPIE developer meetings**.

As the name says this meetings are open for everyone interested in recent developer
discussions around the model. In the meetings recent issues and developments are
being discussed and next steps in development are being planned.

The meetings take place Wednesdays **11am CEST/CET** every 4 weeks (please mind
the clock change end of October). The next dates are:

* Wednesday **27th Oct 2021 11am CEST**
* Wednesday **24th Nov 2021 11am CET**
* ~~Wednesday **22nd Dec 2021 11am CET**~~ (cancelled due to holidays)
* Wednesday **19th Jan 2022 11am CET**

If you having received the meeting credentials yet, please get in touch with us
via <magpie@pik-potsdam.de> and we will send you an invitation. Meeting credentials
will stay the same for all meetings. So, if you already have received them you
can re-use them for all following meetings.
